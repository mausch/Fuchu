# Fuchu #

**Fuchu** is a test library for .NET, supporting C# and VB.NET but with a special focus on F#.
It draws heavily from Haskell's [test-framework](http://batterseapower.github.com/test-framework/) and [HUnit](http://hunit.sourceforge.net/).
You can read about the rationale and underlying concepts in [this blog post](http://bugsquash.blogspot.com/2012/06/fuchu-functional-test-library-for-net.html),
or TL;DR: tests should be first-class values so that you can move them around and execute
them in any context that you want. Also, if they are first-class values, then you can take
extra care with what the test methods return, making integrations with external libraries
much cheaper.

## Binaries ##

Binaries are available on [NuGet](http://nuget.org/packages?q=Fuchu).

## Writing tests ##

Here's the simplest test possible:

    open Fuchu

    let simpleTest = 
        testCase "A simple test" <| 
            fun _ -> Assert.Equal("2+2", 4, 2+2)

Tests can be grouped (with arbitrary nesting):

    let tests = 
        testList "A test group" [
            testCase "one test" <|
                fun _ -> Assert.Equal("2+2", 4, 2+2)
            testCase "another test" <|
                fun _ -> Assert.Equal("3+3", 3, 3+3)
        ]

In C#:

    static Test ATest {
        get {
            return Test.List("A test group", new[] {
                Test.Case("one test", () => Assert.Equal("2+2", 4, 2+2)),
                Test.Case("another test", () => Assert.Equal("3+3", 3, 3+3)),
            });
        }
    }
    
The first parameter in the assertions describes the assertion. This is usually an optional parameter in most test frameworks; in Fuchu it's required to foster descriptive failures, so you'll get a failure like "3+3 Expected value 3, actual 6" instead of just "Expected value 3, actual 6".

For more examples, including a few ways to do common things in other test frameworks like setup/teardown and parameterized tests, see the [F# tests](https://github.com/mausch/Fuchu/blob/master/Fuchu.Tests/Tests.fs) and the [C# tests](https://github.com/mausch/Fuchu/blob/master/Fuchu.CSharpTests/Program.cs)

## Assertions ##

Fuchu is mainly oriented to test organization. Although it does have a few basic assertions, you're encouraged to write your own specialized assertions for each project (they're only a couple of lines in F#), or use some other library for assertions, like [Unquote](http://code.google.com/p/unquote/), [FsUnit](https://github.com/dmohl/FsUnit), or even MbUnit or NUnit.

## Running tests ##

The test runner is the test assembly itself. It's recommended to compile your test assembly as a console application. You can run a test directly like this:

    run simpleTest // or runParallel
    
which returns 1 if any tests failed, otherwise 0. Useful for returning to the operating system as error code. Or you can mark the top-level test in each test file with the `[<Tests>]` attribute, then define your main like this:

    open Fuchu

    [<EntryPoint>]
    let main args = defaultMainThisAssembly args
    
This `defaultMainThisAssembly` function admits a "/m" parameter passed through the command-line to run tests in parallel.
    
You can single out tests by filtering them by name. For example:

    tests
    |> Test.filter (fun s -> s.EndsWith "another test")
    |> run

You can use the F# REPL to run tests this way.

In C#:

    static int Main(string[] args) {
        return ATest.Run(); // or RunParallel()
    }

Or scanning for tests marked with the [Tests] attribute:

    static int Main(string[] args) {
        return Tests.DefaultMainThisAssembly(args);
    }

## FsCheck integration ##

Reference [FsCheck](http://fscheck.codeplex.com/) and Fuchu.FsCheck to test properties:


    let config = { FsCheck.Config.Default with MaxTest = 10000 }
    
    let properties = 
        testList "FsCheck" [
            testProperty "Addition is commutative" <|
                fun a b -> 
                    a + b = b + a
            
            // you can also override the FsCheck config
            testPropertyWithConfig config "Product is distributive over addition" <|
                fun a b c -> 
                    a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c
        ]

    run properties
    
In C# (can't override FsCheck config at the moment):

    static Test Properties =
        Test.List("FsCheck", new[] {
            FsCheck.Property("Addition is commutative",
                                (int a, int b) => a + b == b + a),
            FsCheck.Property("Product is distributive over addition",
                                (int a, int b, int c) => a * (b + c) == a * b + a * c),
        });

You can freely mix FsCheck properties with regular test cases and test lists.

## PerfUtil integration ##

The integration with Eirik's PerfUtil project.

    open global.PerfUtil

    module Types =
        type Y = { a : string; b : int }

    type Serialiser =
        inherit ITestable
        abstract member Serialise<'a> : 'a -> unit

    type MySlowSerialiser() =
        interface ITestable with
            member x.Name = "Slow Serialiser"
        interface Serialiser with
            member x.Serialise _ =
                System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(30)

    type FastSerialiser() =
        interface ITestable with
            member x.Name = "Fast Serialiser"
        interface Serialiser with
            member x.Serialise _ =
                System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(10)

    type FastSerialiserAlt() =
        interface ITestable with
            member x.Name = "Fast Serialiser Alt"
        interface Serialiser with
            member x.Serialise _ =
                System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(20)

    let alts : Serialiser list = [ FastSerialiser(); FastSerialiserAlt() ]
    let subj = MySlowSerialiser() :> Serialiser

    open Types

    let normal_serlialisation : PerfTest<Serialiser> list = [
        perfTest "serialising string" <| fun s ->
            s.Serialise("wowowow")
        perfTest "serialising record" <| fun s ->
            s.Serialise { a = "hello world"; b = 42 }
        ]

    [<Tests>]
    let tests =
        testList "performance comparison tests" [
            testPerfImpls "implementations of Serialiser" subj alts normal_serlialisation
            testPerfHistory "historical MySlowSerialiser" subj "v1.2.3" normal_serlialisation
        ]

This example shows both a comparison performance test between MySlowSerialiser, FastSerialiser and
FastSerialiserAlt: `testPerfImpls` and a historical comparison of MySlowSerialiser alone
which saves an xml file next to the dll on every run.

You can find detailed docs in the source code of PerfUtil.fs on all parameters and data
structures. All things that can be configured with PerfUtil can be configured with the
`conf` parameter to `testPerfImplsWithConfig` and `testPerfHistoryWithConfig`.

The functions are discoverable by starting with `testPerf*`.

Handle the results explicitly by giving a config with a value of `handleResults`. Use
that if you want to export the data to e.g. CSV or TSV.
